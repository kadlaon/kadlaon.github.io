<h2>&#xf182; About Me</h2>
<hr>
						
<p>Hi, I'm <a href="kadlaon.github.io/Curriculum Vitae.pdf">Kristine</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">Much of my time right now is spent in my academic studies being a Ph.D. student at 
	<a href="https://dlsu.edu.ph">De La Salle University</a> 
  under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com.ph/citations?user=-vU32yoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Dr. Nelson Marcos</a>. I am currently in my dissertation writing stage and hopefully will be 
  having my proposal defense next term (Term 3 of A.Y. 2018 - 2019). My research interest is on natural language processing 
  specifically on machine translation. </p>

<p align="justify">When at the university, you can always find me either in the following places:
<ol>
  <li>10th floor of Andrew Building with my advisor for consultation.</li>
  <li>Center for Language Technologies laboratory doing my projects.</li>
  <li>Henry Sy library watching the sunset. hehe</li>
  <li> Roaming around the campus and just enjoying the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/DLSUPUSA/">DLSU cats</a>. </li> </ol>
</p>
<h3>&#xf19d; Educational Background</h3>
<hr>
<p align="justify">I took up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at the 
	<a href="http://www.usep.edu.ph/">University of Southeastern Philippines</a>. I was one of the project leaders of the Integrated 
	UNIISYS project. I led the project <a href="http://www.rsgamboa.com/2010/04/uniisys-etudlo.html">eTudlo</a> a web-based subsystem 
	of UNIISYS specifically designed for students who would want to offer tutorials to anyone that is willing to learn on particular subjects 
	that he/she finds difficult. These students are ought to be merely from University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP). 
	eTudlo is mainly an online posting of subjects and schedules from service providers.</p>
<p align="justify"> Months after I finished my tertiary education, I then took Master in Information Technology at the 
	<a href="https://www.uic.edu.ph/">University of the Immaculate Conception</a>. It was during my enrollment in this post-graduate study that I was exposed to 
	the <a href="https://csp.org.ph/">Philippine Computing Science Congress</a> and that motivated me to jump from the Information Technology field to Computer Science.</p>
<p align="justify"> Privileged enough, 2 years after I earned my masters degree, I was able to get a St. La Salle Scholarship to fund my Ph.D.
	I then took a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the <a href="https://dlsu.edu.ph">De La Salle University</a> 
	and I am currently in my dissertation writing stage. </p>

<h3>&#xf005; Professional Work Experience</h3>
<hr>
<p align="justify">I am currently connected as an Assistant Professor at the 
	<a href="https://www.uic.edu.ph/">University of the Immaculate Conception</a> (UIC) since 2012. Before filing a study leave, I handled the following 
	subjects:  IT Capstone, Elective Subject (ERP System using SAP Business One), Systems Analysis and Design, Software Engineering, Computer
	Fundamentals, Computer Applications, Introduction to Computer Programming, Object Oriented Programming, and Data Structures.</p>
<p align="justify"> Before UIC, I was a full-time faculty and at the same time the Program Head of MATS College of Technology for 2 years
	from year 2010 - 2012. In this period, I was also a part-time 
	faculty at the <a href="http://www.usep.edu.ph/">University of Southeastern Philippines</a> handling Management and Information Systems subject.</p>
<p align="justify"> During my final year in College, I already worked in the <a href="http://www.comelec.gov.ph/">Comelec </a> as Consolidated and Canvassing Systems Technician 
	(CCST) for the May 2010 Election.</p>
