<h2>About Me</h2>
<hr>
						
<p>Hi, I'm <a href="https://kadlaon.github.io">Kristine</a>.</p>

<p>Much of my time right now is spent in my academic studies being a Ph.D. student at 
	<a href="https://dlsu.edu.ph">De La Salle University</a> 
  under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com.ph/citations?user=-vU32yoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Dr. Nelson Marcos</a>. I am currently in my dissertation writing stage and hopefully will be 
  having my proposal defense next term (Term 3 of A.Y. 2018 - 2019). My research interest is on natural language processing 
  specifically on machine translation. </p>

<p>When at the university, you can always find me either in the following places:</p>
<ol>
  <li>10th floor of Andrew Building with my advisor for consultation.</li>
  <li>Center for Language Technology laboratory doing my projects.</li>
  <li>Henry Sy library watching the sunset. hehe</li>
  <li> Roaming around the campus and just enjoying the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/DLSUPUSA/">DLSU cats</a>. </li>
